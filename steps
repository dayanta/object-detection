Kernel Steering:

for each pixel
	calculate matrix with distance from x
	
	calculate covariance matrix
		sobel operator to window
		covar matrix is:
				sum(gxgx) sum(gxgy)
				sum(gxgy) sum(gygy)

	calculate the determinant of covariance

	find a reasonable value for h
		9 (for 3x3)?

Normalize Kernel:

for each pixel
	take kernel value at point x
	divide that by sum of kernel values in window

for higher order regression repeat this
